# Retold Data Mapper — long-running service.
# Port 8395 by default; serves the cross-beacon mapping web UI + REST
# API at /mapper/*. Connects to an Ultravisor as a beacon when
# DATAMAPPER_ULTRAVISOR_URL is set (or via --ultravisor flag).
#
# `npm install` (not `npm ci`) is intentional — package-lock.json is
# gitignored per the Quackage convention. See BUILDING-AND-PUBLISHING.md.

# Stage 1: Build the bundled web application.
# build-essential + python3 are needed here so npm rebuild can compile
# native bindings (better-sqlite3, etc.). They never make it into the
# runtime image — see Stage 2.

# `--ignore-scripts` because retold-data-mapper depends on `ultravisor`
# (devDep — used only by test harnesses), whose postinstall
# (`cd webinterface && npm install && npm run build`) needs `quack`
# (devDep) and routinely fails inside transitive installs.
# `npm rebuild` afterwards compiles native bindings the ignore-scripts
# would have skipped.
# `--no-optional` skips meadow-connection-rocksdb (peer-optional via
# meadow-connection-manager, ~93 MB native build) — the data-mapper
# doesn't speak RocksDB.

# Stage 2: Runtime — node + the lean prebuilt node_modules from Stage 1.
